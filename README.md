# Parallel-Restaurant_Processing-System-JavaFX
This is a Java-based multi-threaded client-server system with a JavaFX graphical interface. It simulates parallel processing through a thread pool, using `ChiefClient`, `CustomerClient`, and a `Server` that handle requests concurrently. It also connects to a database using JDBC for persistent data storage.
